Description: Compare two classifications that may or may not have the same
    number of classes, and that might have hard or soft (fuzzy, 
    probabilistic) membership. Calculate various metrics to assess how the
    clusters compare to each other. The calculations are simple, but
    provide a handy tool for users unfamiliar with matrix multiplication.
